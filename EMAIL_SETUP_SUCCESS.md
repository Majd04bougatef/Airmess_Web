# ðŸŽ‰ Email Sending Success!

Great news! We've successfully sent an email with the SSL verification disabled. Here's what worked:

## Working Solution

Using the DSN with SSL verification disabled:
```
smtp://oussemabelhajbb22@gmail.com:pukkrnjfybrjlhsr@smtp.gmail.com:587?encryption=tls&auth_mode=login&verify_peer=0&verify_peer_name=0
```

## Steps to Make It Work in Your Application

1. **Create or edit your `.env.local` file** in your project root:
   ```
   ###> symfony/mailer ###
   MAILER_DSN=smtp://oussemabelhajbb22@gmail.com:pukkrnjfybrjlhsr@smtp.gmail.com:587?encryption=tls&auth_mode=login&verify_peer=0&verify_peer_name=0
   ###< symfony/mailer ###
   ```

2. **We've updated your mailer.yaml configuration** with the proper envelope and headers settings.

3. **Clear your cache**:
   ```bash
   php bin/console cache:clear
   ```

4. **Test the application** - your user reactivation emails should now be working!

## If You Still Have Issues

1. Make sure your Gmail account settings allow for app access
2. Try using an app password if you have 2FA enabled
3. Consider using a service like Mailtrap.io for testing
4. Check that port 587 is not blocked by your firewall

## Next Steps

You can now:
- Reactivate users from the admin panel
- Test the email verification flow
- Make sure the links in the emails point to the correct URLs

The fix we implemented will bypass SSL certificate verification, which is acceptable for development but should be properly addressed in production by ensuring your PHP has the proper CA certificates installed.
